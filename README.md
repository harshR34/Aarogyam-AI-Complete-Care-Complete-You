# Aarogyam AI: Holistic Healthcare Chatbot

Aarogyam AI is an advanced AI-powered healthcare assistant providing empathetic guidance, nearby doctor recommendations, and emergency support. It combines **Ollama (MedGemma)** for local, context-aware responses and **Groq (ChatGroq)** for fast, scalable reasoning. The backend is built with **FastAPI**, and the frontend uses **Streamlit** for interactive user experience.
